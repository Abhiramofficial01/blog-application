# Blog Platform

A full-stack blog platform built with Next.js, Fastify, PostgreSQL, and Material-UI. The platform allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog articles, providing a seamless and responsive user interface.

 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework with TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Fastify (Node.js framework)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI
- **Languages**: JavaScript and TypeScript
- **Version Control**: GitHub
- **Deployment**: Cloud service provider (e.g., Vercel, AWS, Heroku)

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for blog articles.
- Responsive UI using Material-UI for a consistent user experience across devices.
- Server-side rendering with Next.js for enhanced SEO and performance.
- Fast, lightweight backend using Fastify.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- PostgreSQL
- Git

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd blog-platform
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up the Database
1. Create a PostgreSQL database named `blog` (or your preferred name).
2. Update the connection string in `server.js` to match your PostgreSQL setup:
   ```javascript
   fastify.register(require('fastify-postgres'), {
     connectionString: 'postgres://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/blog',
   });
   ```

### 4. Run the Backend Server
Start the Fastify server:
```bash
node server.js
```

### 5. Start the Frontend Server
Start the Next.js development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `pages/`: Contains the Next.js page components.
- `components/`: Reusable UI components such as layout and form.
- `server.js`: Fastify server setup and routes.
- `database/`: SQL scripts or database-related files (optional).
- `public/`: Static files (images, icons, etc.).

## Deployment

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**: Deploy to Vercel or another preferred hosting provider.
2. **Backend (Fastify)**: Deploy to a cloud provider such as Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
3. **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Use a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL service like Heroku Postgres, AWS RDS, or DigitalOcean Managed Databases.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store environment variables for your database connection and other settings:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/blog
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /articles`: Retrieve all articles.
- `POST /articles`: Create a new article.
- `PUT /articles/:id`: Update an existing article.
- `DELETE /articles/:id`: Delete an article.

## GitHub Workflow

1. Use separate branches for development and production (e.g., `main` for production, `dev` for development).
2. Follow good commit practices with informative commit messages.
3. Use pull requests to merge changes into the `main` branch after review.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot connect to PostgreSQL**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running, and the connection string in `server.js` is correct.
- **Build errors with Next.js**: Make sure you have either the `pages` or `app` directory set up correctly, but not both.
- **Fastify server not starting**: Verify the port and host settings in `server.js` and check for other applications using the same port.
